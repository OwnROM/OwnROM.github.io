## OwnROM O

*Apr 29, 2018*

Like some of you already know, yes, OwnROM is coming back and i will start with the OnePlus 5T (Dumpling).

However, this time development will not go as fast as you used to, meaning no weekly update but whenever i have some spare time i will work on OwnROM. Thats the only difference from the past.

Everybody can still apply to be a maintainer, web developer, designer or anything that can be helpful...

Hope you will enjoy OwnROM as you used to :)

Current status: Only one more REPO to Own-ify before OwnROM O comes around for Dumpling!
